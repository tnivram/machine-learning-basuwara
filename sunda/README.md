The Sundanese character dataset was used as the 'prototype' dataset, before combining the method for the other data.

In this folder, you can find the Jupyter Notebook for the following purpose.
* splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing dataset
* building and training a CNN model
* developing the bounding box model to detect the character sequence in a word/sentence
